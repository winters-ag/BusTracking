# Real Time Bus Tracking
This is used for a project regarding tracking real time locations of busses around Boston, MA. It will update every 15 seconds with a new location of the busses. Previous locations are not stored, so once the map refreshes they are no longer available.

# To Run
To run this application you can clone it to your pc. You will need to obtain an API key from google maps. One is not needed for the Boston Busses. You will need to insert that api key where is says YOUR_API_KEY.

After you have done that you can run the index.html file to see busses around MIT

# Future plans

## Code Cleanup
Ideally I would like to break this off a bit into multiple JS files to clean it up, but that will have to come later.

I'd also like to research if the way the markers is deleted is the best for memory usage. I'm worried they may hang around after the array is cleared.
